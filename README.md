# surfs_up analysis

## Overview of surfs_up analysis
### Using Python, Pandas functions and methods, and SQLAlchemy, weâ€™ll filter the date column of the Measurements table in the hawaii.sqlite database to retrieve all the temperatures for the month of June. We'll then convert those temperatures to a list, create a DataFrame from the list, and generate the summary statistics. Once our dataframe is created we are able to get our summary statistics by using the df.describe() code and method.

## surfs_up analysis results:
1. Decembers maximum temperature is only 2 degrees lower than Junes maximum temperature. 
2. There was a difference of about 4 degrees between June and December's average temperatures. 
3. The largest gap between December and June came from the minimum temperature with a differance of 8 degrees. December's minimum temperature was 56 degrees while June's was 64.

## Summary:
### Based on our Data Analysis, Data Provided, we can state as a high-level summary of results that Standard deviation is 3.25 in June and 3.75 in December, making a 0.5 difference between both seasons.

In addition, current data provide attributes such precipitation and others, with two queries that our analysis pursue, performing weather data for June and December that helps results to decide how we would like to build the shop and what areas would make this location attractive to visitors to stop by and have a successful business.
