# surfs_up analysis

## Overview of surfs_up analysis
### W. Avy asked if I could help him determine if opening a surf shop in Oahu would be a good investment based on temperature trends on the island. I put together data trends from the months of June and December to help him in this decision. 

## surfs_up analysis results:
1. Decembers maximum temperature is only 2 degrees lower than Junes maximum temperature. 
2. There was a difference of about 4 degrees between June and December's average temperatures. 
3. The largest gap between December and June came from the minimum temperature with a differance of 8 degrees. December's minimum temperature was 56 degrees while June's was 64.

## Summary:
### Based on the surfs_up analysis we can make the assumption that starting a surf and ice cream shop in Oahu would be sustainable year-round. We are only looking at two months out of the year, but even with a 6 month difference June and December had very comparable numbers. 

### We could also take a look at percipitation levels through out the island to determine if there is a better location for either shop to be located. In addition we could also see what the percipitation levels look like by month to determine if there are months where the either business may struggle.
